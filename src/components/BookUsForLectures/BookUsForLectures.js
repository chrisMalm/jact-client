						<b>So we have now&nbsp;</b> a sculptured presentation for the ones
						who needs/wants us to give them a behind the scenes picture of a
						negotiation and also when we do the matchmaking between different

						<b>We believe&nbsp;</b>
						that the more people we can reach out to and give the 360 angel and
						perspective of the complexity with a contract, transfer and the
						things you need to do to make everybody happy - the more we help our
						sport to reach the place we want to come to.<br></br>
