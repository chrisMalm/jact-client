        After getting emails from different people from clubs and Floorball schools
        asking us if we could come to them and have lectures about what we do and 
        how we do it, we think itâ€™s great signals that we doing things right.<br></br>
        So we have now a sculptured presentation for the ones who needs/wants us
        to give them a behind the scenes picture of a negotiation and also when we
        do the matchmaking between different clubs and players.<br></br>
        We believe that the more people we can reach out to and give the 360 angel
        and perspective of the complexity with a contract, transfer and the things
        you need to do to make everybody happy - the more we help our sport to reach
        the place we want to come to.<br></br>
        So are you as a club or a school interesting in this string in JACT,
        just email us and we can talk about making it happen!
